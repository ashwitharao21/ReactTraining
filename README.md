# React Hooks

Some of the popular ones include:

`useState`: returns a stateful value
`useEffect`: perform side effects from function components
`useContext`: accepts a context objects and returns current context value
`useCallback`: pass an inline callback and an array of dependencies

# Some benefits of hooks are:
- Isolating stateful logic, making it easier to test
- Sharing stateful logic without render props or higher-order components
- Separating your appâ€™s concerns based on logic
- Avoiding ES6 classes
